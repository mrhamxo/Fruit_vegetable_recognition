# Fruit_vegetable_recognition
 
## Project Summary
The Fruit and Vegetable Recognition project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify and classify various fruits and vegetables from images. By utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), the system processes visual data to distinguish between different types of produce. This project has practical applications in areas such as automated checkout systems in supermarkets, quality control in agriculture, and dietary tracking applications.

## Objectives
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and preprocess a diverse dataset of images representing different fruits and vegetables.
2. **Model Development**: Design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize and classify the fruits and vegetables in the dataset.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable classification.
4. **Deployment**: Develop a system that can take new images as input and output the correct fruit or vegetable classification in real-time.
